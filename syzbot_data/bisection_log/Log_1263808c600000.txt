Author: Keith Busch <keith.busch@intel.com>

    blk-mq: Remove generation seqeunce
    
    This patch simplifies the timeout handling by relying on the request
    reference counting to ensure the iterator is operating on an inflight
    and truly timed out request. Since the reference counting prevents the
    tag from being reallocated, the block layer no longer needs to prevent
    drivers from completing their requests while the timeout handler is
    operating on it: a driver completing a request is allowed to proceed to
    the next state without additional syncronization with the block layer.
    
    This also removes any need for generation sequence numbers since the
    request lifetime is prevented from being reallocated as a new sequence
    while timeout handling is operating on it.
    
    To enables this a refcount is added to struct request so that request
    users can be sure they're operating on the same request without it
    changing while they're processing it.  The request's tag won't be
    released for reuse until both the timeout handler and the completion
    are done with it.
