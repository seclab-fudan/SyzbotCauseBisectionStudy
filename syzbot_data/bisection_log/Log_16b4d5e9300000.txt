    bpf: Add kernel/modules BTF presence checks to bpftool feature command
    
    This adds both the CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF and CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF_MODULES
    kernel compile option to output of the bpftool feature command.
    
    This is relevant for developers that want to account for data structure
    definition differences between kernels.
