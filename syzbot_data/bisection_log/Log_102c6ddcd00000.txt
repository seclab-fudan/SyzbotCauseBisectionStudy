daaedb820ad716e00210af8859b194c404202b78 is the first bad commit
commit daaedb820ad716e00210af8859b194c404202b78
Author: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
Date:   Tue Nov 3 11:00:09 2020 +0100

    mtd_blkdevs: don't override BLKFLSBUF
    
    BLKFLSBUF is not supposed to actually send a flush command to the device,
    but to tear down buffer cache structures.  Remove the mtd_blkdevs
    implementation and just use the default semantics instead.
