766b0515d5bec4b780750773ed3009b148df8c0a is the first bad commit
commit 766b0515d5bec4b780750773ed3009b148df8c0a
Author: Jakub Kicinski <kuba@kernel.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 6 10:40:07 2021 -0800

    net: make sure devices go through netdev_wait_all_refs
    
    If register_netdevice() fails at the very last stage - the
    notifier call - some subsystems may have already seen it and
    grabbed a reference. struct net_device can't be freed right
    away without calling netdev_wait_all_refs().
    
    Now that we have a clean interface in form of dev->needs_free_netdev
    and lenient free_netdev() we can undo what commit 93ee31f14f6f ("[NET]:
    Fix free_netdev on register_netdev failure.") has done and complete
    the unregistration path by bringing the net_set_todo() call back.
    
    After registration fails user is still expected to explicitly
    free the net_device, so make sure ->needs_free_netdev is cleared,
    otherwise rolling back the registration will cause the old double
    free for callers who release rtnl_lock before the free.
    
    This also solves the problem of priv_destructor not being called
    on notifier error.
    
    net_set_todo() will be moved back into unregister_netdevice_queue()
    in a follow up.
