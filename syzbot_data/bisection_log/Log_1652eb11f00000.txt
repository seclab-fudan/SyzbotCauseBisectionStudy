    net: dsa: bcm_sf2_cfp: fix an incorrect NULL check on list iterator
    
    The bug is here:
            return rule;
    
    The list iterator value 'rule' will *always* be set and non-NULL
    by list_for_each_entry(), so it is incorrect to assume that the
    iterator value will be NULL if the list is empty or no element
    is found.
    
    To fix the bug, return 'rule' when found, otherwise return NULL.
