    blk-mq: Fix a comment in include/linux/blk-mq.h
    
    The 'hctx_list' member of struct blk_mq_hw_ctx is not a list head but
    instead an entry in q->unused_hctx_list. Fix the comment above this
    struct member.

crash: possible deadlock in vmci_qp_broker_detach
============================================
WARNING: possible recursive locking detected
5.6.0-rc5-syzkaller #0 Not tainted
--------------------------------------------
syz-executor.2/13606 is trying to acquire lock:
ffffffff8b0fe8d0 (qp_broker_list.mutex){+.+.}, at: vmci_qp_broker_detach+0x122/0xe90 drivers/misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_queue_pair.c:2083

but task is already holding lock:

other info that might help us debug this:
 Possible unsafe locking scenario:

       CPU0
       ----
  lock(qp_broker_list.mutex);
  lock(qp_broker_list.mutex);

 *** DEADLOCK ***

 May be due to missing lock nesting notation
