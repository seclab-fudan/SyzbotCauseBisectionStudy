commit b8a51b38e4d4dec3e379d52c0fe1a66827f7cf1e
Author: Stefano Brivio <sbrivio@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 8 12:19:23 2018 +0100

    fou, fou6: ICMP error handlers for FoU and GUE
    
    As the destination port in FoU and GUE receiving sockets doesn't
    necessarily match the remote destination port, we can't associate errors
    to the encapsulating tunnels with a socket lookup -- we need to blindly
    try them instead. This means we don't even know if we are handling errors
    for FoU or GUE without digging into the packets.
    
    Hence, implement a single handler for both, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6,
    that will check whether the packet that generated the ICMP error used a
    direct IP encapsulation or if it had a GUE header, and send the error to
    the matching protocol handler, if any.
