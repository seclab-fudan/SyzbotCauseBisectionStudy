dbb58e291cd47e594b64293bd91a4ce40626513c is the first bad commit
commit dbb58e291cd47e594b64293bd91a4ce40626513c
Author: Adam Ford <aford173@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 2 14:19:08 2019 -0500

    ARM: dts: imx6q-logicpd: Reduce inrush current on start
    
    The main 3.3V regulator sources a series of additional regulators.
    This patch adds a small delay, so when the 3.3V regulator comes
    on it delays a bit before the subsequent regulators can come on.
    This reduces the inrush current a bit on the external DC power
    supply to help prevent a situation where the sourcing power supply
    cannot source enough current and overloads and the kit fails to
    start.
