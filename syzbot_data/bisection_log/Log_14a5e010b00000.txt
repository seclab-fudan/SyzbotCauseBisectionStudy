d4b54d2d52840bc578b21df4186c5300982236ab is the first bad commit
commit d4b54d2d52840bc578b21df4186c5300982236ab
Author: Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@kernel.org>
Date:   Wed Jun 23 17:07:06 2021 -0700

    torture: Move parse-console.sh call to PATH-aware scripts
    
    The last line of kvm-test-1-run-qemu.sh invokes parse-console.sh, but
    kvm-test-1-run-qemu.sh is unaware of the PATH containing this script
    and does not have the job title handy.  This commit therefore moves
    the invocation of parse-console.sh to kvm-test-1-run.sh, which has
    PATH and title at hand.  This commit does not add an invocation of
    parse-console.sh to kvm-test-1-run-batch.sh because this latter script
    is run in the background, and the information will be gathered at the
    end of the full run.
